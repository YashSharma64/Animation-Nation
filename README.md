## üî• Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

### 1. Fork This Repository

Forking creates a copy of this project on your GitHub account. Need help? Check out these resources:

- [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines)
- [How to Fork a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Once forked, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Animation-Nation.git
```
### 3. Create A Branch

Working in the master or main branch is often frowned upon and are usually expected to branch off. Branching also helps to reduce the chance of a merge conflict.

### 4. Create Your Artwork

Now for the fun part! Inside the `Art/` folder:

- Create a new directory named: <github_username>-<art_name> eg. `mattcsmith-helloworld`.
- Inside **your** folder, create an `index.html` file
- Inside **your** folder, create an `styles.css` file
- Inside **your** folder, create an `meta.json` file   
to specify your art name, github author and github link  
Note: copy the following snippet and replace only the values with your own details,  
Do not change the JSON keys.
```json
// Example
{
    "artName": "hello world",
    "githubHandle": "mattcsmith"
}
```
- Use these to create your **animated artwork** ‚Äî let your creativity flow!

‚ö†Ô∏è It is important to name the directory and your files exactly as mentioned above ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

After completing your artwork, you are now ready to create a pull request and have it added to the collection.
